	    <h2 class="header2">Client and Topic</h2>

	    	<p class="headertwoparagraph">
	    	I have decided to make my final project a website for my small business, Eat with Kaon. I started this business after years of cooking as a hobby and sharing my passion for food through social media videos, recipes, and custom seasonings. The website will serve as a platform to showcase my recipes, market my seasonings, and provide cooking tips. This project reflects my journey from a personal passion to a growing side hustle and aims to attract both loyal followers and new customers interested in home cooking. 
	    	</p>

	    <h2 class="header2">Development and Engagement</h2>
	    	<p class="headertwoparagraph">
	    	This website will be created for my small business. Although I am the sole creator, I will consult with my brother, who has supported me since I started this venture. To gather input, I will ask him questions such as: 
	    	</p>

	    	<ul>
				<li>How often do you visit recipe websites?</li>
				<li>What features make a website engaging for users?</li> 
				<li>What elements are essential for a user-friendly experience?</li>
			</ul>

			<p>
			Additionally, I will conduct research by reviewing well-known recipe websites like Allrecipes and Smitten Kitchen to analyze their layout, structure, and design features. This analysis will inform decisions about the color schemes, layouts, and features to implement on my site. I aim to identify user expectations and pain points to create a seamless experience. This research will also help shape the user personas for the project. 
	    	</p>

	    <h2 class="header2">Testing</h2>
	    	<p class="headertwoparagraph">
	    	Before launching the website, I will conduct user testing to ensure its functionality and user-friendliness. Specifically, I will: 
	    	</p>

	    	<ul>
				<li>Share the website with family and friends, requesting feedback on design, navigation, content, and usability.</li>
				<li>Ask users to test the form submission and check the clarity of instructions.</li>
				<li>Review key pages like Home, Recipes, Shop, and Contact for readability, visual appeal, and overall engagement.</li>
				<li>Test the website on multiple browsers, including Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge, to ensure compatibility.</li>
				<li>Verify that the layout and functionality are responsive across devices (desktop, tablet, and mobile).</li>
			</ul>
			
			<p>
			Through this process, I will address any feedback and make improvements to ensure the site is professional and functional. 
	    	</p>

	    <h2 class="header2">Growth and Maintenance</h2>

	    	<p class="headertwoparagraph">
	    	As my business grows, the website will expand to include additional recipes, products, and potentially a blog section. Features like user accounts for saving recipes or an interactive recipe rating system could be implemented in the future. 

			To simplify maintenance, I will organize the site with clear file structures and use reusable CSS and JavaScript components. Regular tasks include updating recipes, managing the product catalog, and addressing user feedback. Content updates will occur weekly, while major design revisions may be reviewed quarterly. 
	    	</p>

	    <h2 class="header2">Organization</h2>

	    	<p class="headertwoparagraph">
	    	The website will follow a simple and user-friendly structure, organized around the five main pages you have outlined. This layout ensures clarity and ease of navigation for visitors while maintaining consistency throughout the site.</p>

	    	<p class="headertwoparagraph">

			<i>Page Structure:</i>
					
			<ol>
				<li><i>Home:</i> The landing page that introduces visitors to "Eat with Kaon." It will include a hero image, a short welcome message, and links to other sections.</li>

				<li><i>Recipes:</i> A collection of recipes organized into easy-to-browse categories with thumbnails and short descriptions for each recipe.</li>
 
				<li><i>Shop:</i> A showcase of the seasonings available for purchase, complete with descriptions, pricing, and an option to order.</li>

				<li><i>About Me:</i> A personal section sharing the story behind the brand and my journey as a cook and small business owner.</li>

				<li><i>Contact:</i> A form for users to send inquiries or feedback, with fields for name, email, and a message.</li>
			</ol>

			<p>
				<i>Layout and Navigation:</i>
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li>A fixed top navigation bar will contain links to the five main pages, ensuring consistent access from anywhere on the site.</li>

				<li>Each page will include a header with the logo and a footer linking to the privacy policy, social media, and contact details.</li>
			</ul>

        <div class="responsive">
            <div class="gallery">
            <figure>
                <a href="images/allrecipes600.png" target="_blank">
                    <img src="images/allrecipes.png" alt="Allrecipes Site Map">
                </a>
                <figcaption class="desc">Screenshot of the Allrecipes site map showcasing navigation layout.</figcaption>
            </figure>
            </div>

			<p>
			The Allrecipes website employs a structured and user-friendly navigation layout that organizes its content into clear categories, such as "Meals," "Ingredients," and "Occasions." By grouping content in this way, the site ensures that users can quickly find what they are looking for, which enhances overall accessibility and engagement. 

			Key features include a visually distinct top navigation bar with dropdown menus, allowing users to explore subcategories without leaving the main page. Additionally, Allrecipes incorporates dynamic sections like "News" and "Cyber Monday," which add seasonal relevance and keep the site content fresh. 

			Examining this structure highlights how categorizing content logically and presenting it visually can improve a user's browsing experience. For instance, the site's "Kitchen Tips" and "Occasions" sections cater to specific user needs, making the navigation both intuitive and goal oriented. 

			This approach can serve as a guide when designing a site layout for "Eat with Kaon." While my structure will differ in content focus, observing the effectiveness of Allrecipes' design provides valuable insights into organizing content and creating a seamless user experience.

	    <h2 class="header2">Web Hosting</h2>

	    	<p class="headertwoparagraph">
	    	When selecting a web host, the following criteria will guide my decision:</p>

	    	<ul>
				<li><i>Reliability and Uptime:</i> A host with a strong reputation for high uptime ensures the website is always accessible to visitors.</li>

				<li><i>Support for Essential Technologies:</i> The host must support HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with the option to expand to PHP or databases in the future if e-commerce functionality is added.</li>

				<li><i>Affordable Pricing:</i> As a small business, I’ll prioritize a cost-effective hosting plan without sacrificing essential features like security and performance.</li>

				<li><i>SSL Certificate:</i> A host that includes SSL certificates will be chosen to ensure a secure, HTTPS-enabled site.</li>
			</ul>

	    <h2 class="header2">Marketing</h2>

	    	<p class="headertwoparagraph">
	    	The website will be marketed primarily through social media channels, where I have an existing audience for my cooking videos. Strategies will include:</p>

	    	<ul>
				<li><i>SEO Implementation:</i> Each page will have optimized title tags, meta descriptions, and keywords like “home cooking,” “seasonings,” and “easy recipes.”</li>

				<li><i>Cross-Promotion:</i> Share links to the website on Instagram, Facebook, and YouTube, where my cooking content already engages viewers.</li>

				<li><i>Email Campaigns:</i> Set up a newsletter subscription form to keep followers updated on new recipes and products.</li>
			</ul>

	    <h2 class="header2">Security</h2>

	    	<p class="headertwoparagraph">
	    	The website will not include e-commerce functionality initially, so there will be no need for payment processing or account creation. However, security is still essential to protect visitor data and maintain trust.</p>
 
	    	<ul>
	    		<li><i>Password Protection:</i> There will be no password-protected sections since all content will be freely accessible to users. This simplifies access and avoids unnecessary barriers.</li>
	    	</ul>
	    	
	    	<ul>
	    		<li><i>Steps for Security:</i></li>
	    	</ul>
	    			<ul>
						<li>Use HTTPS to encrypt data exchanged between users and the server.</li>
						<li>Regularly update and secure the website’s code to prevent vulnerabilities.</li>
						<li>Implement CAPTCHA on the contact form to prevent spam submissions.</li>
						<li>Sanitize and validate all input fields to prevent cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks or SQL injection vulnerabilities.</li>
					</ul>
